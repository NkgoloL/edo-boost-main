# EduBoost SA Functional Implementation Roadmap

This roadmap converts all user-facing and platform functionalities declared in `README.md` into implementation tracks with concrete completion criteria.

Strategic requirement: EduBoost must own core intelligence in-platform. Lesson generation should run on EduBoost-hosted nano open-source models (fine-tuned for CAPS and local context), not as a thin proxy to external proprietary model APIs.

## How to Use This Roadmap

- Mark each checkbox as work is completed and verified.
- Do not mark an item complete without tests and docs updates.
- Treat "Done" as: implemented, tested, observable, and documented.
- Use the codebase as the source of truth when this roadmap and implementation reports drift.

## Implementation Status Legend

- `[ ]` Not started
- `[~]` In progress
- `[x]` Implemented and verified

### Core Functionality
- [x] Implement reliable IRT calibration and scoring pipeline for Grade R-7 diagnostics.
- [x] Support item bank versioning and difficulty/discrimination metadata management.
- [~] Deliver per-learner knowledge gap detection at concept level (not only subject level).
- [x] Return confidence intervals and decision thresholds for level placement.

### API + Product Behavior
- [x] Expose stable diagnostic endpoints with request/response contracts.
- [x] Persist diagnostic attempts, outcomes, and progression history.
- [~] Provide frontend diagnostic UX flow with retry/re-entry support.

### Validation
- [x] Add unit tests for scoring logic and edge-case handling.
- [x] Add integration tests for full diagnostic flow from API to persistence.
- [ ] Add benchmark checks for accuracy and response-time limits.

### Current Status (Apr 2026)

- ✅ Database persistence of diagnostic sessions/responses
- ⚠️ Concept-level gap handling exists but still needs broader item-bank depth and quality checks
- ❌ Item bank still needs 100+ calibrated items per subject/grade

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Select and baseline at least one nano open-source model family suitable for local inference (e.g., <= 7B class, quantized variants).

- [x] Add an offline-capable inference mode for low-connectivity deployments.

### Model Ops + Safety + Governance
- [ ] Build a curated CAPS-aligned training corpus with provenance tracking and licensing checks.

- [x] Add output quality guardrails (age appropriateness, factuality checks, toxicity filters, curriculum adherence checks).
- [~] Implement model fallback policy across EduBoost-managed model versions/sizes (not external APIs).
- [ ] Track model version, training recipe, dataset snapshot, and inference config lineage for reproducibility.
- [ ] Define model promotion gates (dev -> staging -> production) based on objective evaluation thresholds.

### Validation
- [x] Add unit tests for orchestration, inference adapters, and lesson post-processors.
- [x] Add integration tests for lesson generation API paths with locally served model runtime.

### Current Status (Apr 2026)
- ✅ Full lesson generation pipeline exists
